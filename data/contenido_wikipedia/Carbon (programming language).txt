 Carbon is an experimental programming language designed for interoperability with C++.[1] The project is open-source and was started at Google. Google engineer Chandler Carruth first introduced Carbon at the CppNorth conference in Toronto in July 2022. He stated that Carbon was created to be a C++ successor.[2][3][4] The language is expected to have a 1.0 release in 2024 or 2025.[5] The language intends to fix several perceived shortcomings of C++[6] but otherwise provides a similar feature set.
The main goals of the language are readability and "bi-directional interoperability" (which allows the user to include C++ code in the Carbon file), as opposed to using a new language like Rust, that, while being influenced by C++, is not two-way compatible with C++ programs. Changes to the language will be decided by the Carbon leads.[7][8][9][10] Carbon's documents, design, implementation, and related tools are hosted on GitHub under the Apache-2.0 license with LLVM Exceptions.[11]
